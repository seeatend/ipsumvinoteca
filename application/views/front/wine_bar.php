                <p>Our wine bar, separate from the restaurant and open to everyone, not just our restaurant guests, offer an unmatched choice of Italian drinks, from wines to juices, from spirits to soft drinks, all from small producers, all artisanally made, with more than 30 wines by the glass, constantly changing, and more than 300 available by the bottle continually growing . Our wine list has been awarded “best wine list” at the Italian English Awards in 2015 and after our win, the category has been taken off. <br><br>
But we are not just wine, wine is our strength, but we also offer one of the biggest selection of Italian craft beers in the UK, if not the biggest, with over 70 beers available from micro brewery. <br><br>
For our drinks offering we teamed up with Italyabroad.com, that has been importing Italian wine and food since 2003, we use their noses and expertise to design our drinks menu. <br><br>
The bar, open 7 days a week, from morning to night, also offer a wide selection of food to accompany your drink, from pastries to snacks, from platters to burgers and plenty of daily specials prepared by our chefs, the food at the bar is served all day.
